The "**Fourier Analysis**" is one of the most useful tool when we try to study real (and complex) function. These function of course appear naturally in many places, for example:
 - **Physics**: position, speed, force, temperature, etc. ,
 - **Digital representations**: like pixels in images, sound in audio file, or movement in animation
 - **"Abstract" quantities**: stock market prices, or even measuring "popularity" in social media sites.

These "real functions" come in several flavors, according to their domains, and the most common types are:
1. Functions on the real line:  $f:\RR \to \RR$, 
2. Periodic functions, namely $f:\RR \to \RR$, with some period $T>0$, so that $f(x+T)=f(x)$,
3. Finite and discrete domain $f:\{1,...,n\} \to \RR$, or 
4. Infinite and discrete domain $f: \ZZ \to \RR$ , or as we usually call them sequences.
